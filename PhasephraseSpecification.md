Absolutely! Below is a **comprehensive, developer-ready specification** for your passphrase generator website. This document includes all requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan.

## **Passphrase Generator Website Specification**

---

### **1. Functional Requirements**

#### **Core Features**
1. **Passphrase Generation**:
   - Generate random passphrases using a predefined list of words.
   - Words are separated by hyphens (e.g., "apple-banana-cherry").
   - Default passphrase length: **3 words**.
   - User-adjustable range: **2 to 6 words**.

2. **Configuration Options**:
   - **Include Numbers**:
     - Replaces similar-looking letters with numbers (e.g., "appl3" for "apple").
     - Supported replacements: `1` for `l`, `3` for `e`, `4` for `a`, `5` for `s`, `7` for `T`, `8` for `b`, `9` for `g`.
   - **Include Symbols**:
     - Replaces similar-looking letters with symbols (e.g., "@" for "a", "$" for "s").
   - Users can toggle between:
     - Numbers only.
     - Symbols only.
     - Both numbers and symbols.
     - Neither (plain words).

3. **Strength Indicator**:
   - Displays the strength of the generated passphrase using **color-coded text**:
     - **Weak** (red): Short length (2-3 words), no numbers or symbols.
     - **Medium** (yellow): Moderate length (4 words), includes numbers or symbols.
     - **Strong** (green): Long length (5-6 words), includes both numbers and symbols.

4. **Copy Functionality**:
   - A **"Copy to Clipboard" button** is displayed next to the generated passphrase.
   - The passphrase itself is **clickable** to copy it.
   - Passphrases in the **History section** are also clickable to copy.

5. **Regenerate Button**:
   - A **"Regenerate" button** allows users to quickly generate a new passphrase using the same settings.

6. **History Section**:
   - Displays the **last 2 generated passphrases**.
   - Each passphrase in the history is clickable to copy.

7. **Reset Button**:
   - A **"Reset" button** clears all user-selected settings and resets to default values:
     - 3 words.
     - No numbers.
     - No symbols.

### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **Performance**
- The website should load in under **2 seconds** on average.
- Passphrase generation should occur in **less than 100ms**.

#### **Usability**
- The interface should be intuitive and accessible to users of all technical levels.
- Tooltips should provide clear explanations for all configuration options.

#### **Security**
- No user data (e.g., generated passphrases) should be stored or transmitted to a server.
- The word list should be stored locally (no external API calls).

#### **Compatibility**
- The website should be fully responsive and functional on:
  - Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
  - Mobile (iOS, Android).

---

### **3. Architecture and Technology Stack**

#### **Frontend**
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design.
  - [Clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) for copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- **Hosting**: Static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

#### **Backend**
- Not required for this version. All functionality is handled client-side.

---

### **4. Data Handling**

#### **Word List**
- A predefined list of **1,000 common, easy-to-remember words** will be stored in a JavaScript array.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const wordList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "dog", "elephant", ...];
  ```

#### **Passphrase Generation Logic**
1. Randomly select words from the `wordList` based on the user-selected word count.
2. Apply number and symbol replacements if toggled:
   - Numbers: Replace similar-looking letters (e.g., "apple" → "appl3").
   - Symbols: Replace similar-looking letters (e.g., "apple" → "@pple").
3. Combine words with hyphens to form the passphrase.

#### **History Storage**
- Store the last 2 generated passphrases in a JavaScript array.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let history = ["appl3-b@nana-ch3rry", "d0g-eleph@nt-fr0g"];
  ```

---

### **5. Error Handling**

#### **Input Validation**
- Ensure the word count is within the valid range (2 to 6 words).
- If invalid input is detected, display a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Please select a word count between 2 and 6.").

#### **Copy Functionality**
- If the clipboard API fails (e.g., due to browser restrictions), display a fallback message (e.g., "Failed to copy. Please select and copy manually.").

#### **Edge Cases**
- If the word list is empty or inaccessible, display an error message (e.g., "Unable to generate passphrase. Please try again later.").

---

### **6. Testing Plan**

#### **Unit Testing**
- Test the passphrase generation logic:
  - Ensure words are selected randomly.
  - Verify number and symbol replacements work correctly.
  - Validate hyphen-separated formatting.
- Test the strength indicator logic:
  - Verify strength is calculated correctly based on length and complexity.

#### **Integration Testing**
- Test the interaction between configuration options and passphrase generation.
- Verify the "Copy to Clipboard" functionality works across browsers.
- Test the "History" section to ensure it stores and displays the last 2 passphrases correctly.

#### **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
- Test the website with real users to ensure:
  - The interface is intuitive.
  - Tooltips are helpful.
  - All features work as expected.

#### **Browser Compatibility Testing**
- Test the website on:
  - Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
  - Mobile: iOS, Android.

### **7. Deliverables**

1. **Frontend Code**:
   - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   - Predefined word list.
2. **Deployed Website**:
   - Hosted on a static hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
3. **Documentation**:
   - README file with setup instructions.
   - Comments in the code for key functionality.
